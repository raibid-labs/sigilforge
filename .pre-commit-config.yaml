# Pre-commit hooks for Sigilforge
#
# This configuration runs formatting and linting checks before each commit.
#
# Setup:
#   1. Install pre-commit: pip install pre-commit
#   2. Install hooks: pre-commit install
#   3. (Optional) Run manually: pre-commit run --all-files
#
# The hooks will run automatically on `git commit`. If any hook fails,
# the commit will be blocked until the issues are fixed.
#
# To run the same checks manually without committing:
#   just check-all
